* README
Trimdat allows users to upload .csv or .txt files and use our web app to auto-magically clean the data. Users can create new profiles/login to see old files or upload new ones, choose from an array of options on what they would like done to their file (i.e. remove duplicate data, view word count, sort A<->Z), and email themselves a copy of the trimmed data.  

* MVP Goals
Users will be able to:
- create a new account
- sign in/out of existing account
- update their profile
- upload a new csv/txt file
- see all uploaded csv/txt files
- beautify files, with options including deduplification, viewing word count using a search function, and sorting a <-> z
- email beautified files to themselves and others with existing profiles
- delete previously saved files
- view/edit/email files on their account

* Reach Goals
- return/email files in different formats
- public vs private files
- creating teams of users
- e-commerce (providing more services for a small fee)

* Topics of Research
- uploading csv files
- parsing data within csv and txt files
- transforming files into other types of files (formatting)
- saving large files to our database
- login using Google and auto-save to their google sheets
- format data into html tables or convert to pdf
